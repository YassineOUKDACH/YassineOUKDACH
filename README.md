## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
<h5>My name is Yassine OUKDACH, and I hold a doctorate in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in the healthcare domain. Specifically, my thesis and ongoing work are centered on the automatic detection of gastrointestinal diseases using data generated by capsule endoscopy, employing AI-based approaches. I am also a data scientist with expertise in analyzing and interpreting complex datasets, covering the entire pipeline from data preparation to model deployment.<h5>
